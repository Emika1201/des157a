        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>The Project that I will be updating is my Every Picture project and I will be focusing on the UX/UI aspect of the functionality.</p>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>For the project, I want to focus more on the UI and UX aspect of the website.
            For instance, I want to include more hovering animations on the charms and also 
            the bracelet image. I want the user to be able to zoom in and out of the bracelet 
            and also make it more interactive. I also want to make sure that there are more animated 
            design elements that move around in the project so that there is less negative space and
            make it more messy just like a journal, but at the same time make it easy to navigate 
            and read the information.</p>

        <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
        <p> I have spoken to Andrew Kim who is a graphic designer. He mentioned that my website content
            and design refer back to who I am as a person. He mentions that he can get a good idea of the
            kind of personality I have and what my interests are. He does mention a few critiques where he
            thinks that I should try adjusting the font of the website because as a user the font can be hard
            to read. He also suggests keeping in mind the mobile dimensions because even though on the laptop
            the dimensions are good, he thinks that it would be great to try to design the website to fit the 
            screen of smaller devices.  </p>

            <p>Another person I have spoken to is named Sohum Aluri who is a financial consultant. I wanted to give 
            a diverse user report, so the first person was a report from a designer and the second report was from
            a financial consultant. He also mentioned that liked the flow of the overall website and it was easy to 
            navigate when going through my website. He did mention that the hovering interaction was quite cool and also
            thought that the color scheme was very well done because the content was easy to read. One critique he did mention 
            is that maybe making the images a little bit larger so that all the details in the picture could also be seen.</p>
