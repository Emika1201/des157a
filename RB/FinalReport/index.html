        <h2>Visual Design Critiques & Report</h2>
        <p>The person who critiqued my work is named Louise Lee and she is a UX Researcher at a company
        in Boston named Waters. She has been a UX Researcher for four years and has experience in 
        human factors and design. Another person who critiqued my work is named Rachel Lee and she 
        is currently a Product Owner in the company Keurig. She also has experience in human factors
        and deals with branding at the company. Her role as a product owner allows her to analyze 
        different users and also understand the brand’s visuals in order to help advertise the product 
        she makes. They both have good experience in design and branding because they both understand 
        the important principles of branding visually and understand the user’s perspective to create 
        successful product.</p>
        <p>They had mentioned that my design is overall very clean and simple, and it is very easy to navigate.
        They also like how the different designs elements are like handwritten and the arrow is like a scribble, 
        in order to show the theme of a "journal". However, they mentioned that I should resize some images and align 
        some of the information in the website. They also think that I should add a "table of content", so it is easier
        for the user to navigate and select which part they want to read about. They also had mentioined about including
        some more elements in the background because they think it feels "empty as well".
        </p>
        <p> Below are some of the critiques that they had written for me on the visuals of the website.</p>
