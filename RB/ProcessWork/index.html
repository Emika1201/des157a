        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>I have decided to improve the UI/UX Design of my website. I have decided to include an overlay in the beginning of my website and the user would have to click the button 
            in order to enter my website. I have also added some more visual designs in the website to make it more journal like and to fill up the negative space. I also enlarged some of the images
            for the user to be able to see the details of the image. I also enlarged and changed the font of each description under every picture, so it is easier to read. I have included a link of my prototype below.</p>

        <img src = "images/Overlay.png" alt = "decoration" height = "70%" width = "70%">
