                <p> There are 2 players. If the turn lands on one of the players than they have to roll the dice
                Everytime each player rolls, the points are added together, unless either player's die has a "1". 
                If one of the player's dice is a "1", it becomes the other player's turn. After each roll the player
                has a choice to "roll again" or "pass" if either player does not draw a "1". The first player that get 
                30 points or more is the winner.</p>

                <p>If a player rolls two "1's"(snake eyes), then that player's points resets to zero and they have to start over.</p>
