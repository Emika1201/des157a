        <p>According to the article named, Best Practice for Modals/ Overlays/ Dialog Windows, written by Naema Baskanderi,
        talks about the best way to create a user interface for the design of a modal, overlays, and dialog windows. I 
        thought this article was very informative on how to create a good modal design for users that are scrolling through
        the website. The article mentions the different ways that modals are used in the interface design, and one of the 
        ways that I agree most with was that modals “grab the user's attention”. The reason why I think modals grab the 
        attention of hundreds of users is because it acts like a pop-up and so sometimes you can't see the overall 
        UI of the website, however, you only see the modal window. The user can only see most of the content in 
        the modal but you can't see the website page because the modal is in front of it. For example, when I was 
        trying to log into a new article website like Washington Post, I could have a few articles to read, however 
        after I used up all the free articles, they would pop up a sign-up modal for the user to sign up and pay monthly 
        to be able to read unlimited articles. This technique had definitely made me only focus on the modal because everything
        in the background (website page) was blurred so that I am only allowed to see the sign-up modal rather than the articles.
        I think it is important to blur a background when a modal is popped up, because it becomes a focal point and there aren't
        other things behind the modal that are distracting for the user.</p>

            <p>According to the article by Medium named, Best Practices for Form Design,
            written by Salim Ansari, mentions the significance of forming the right UX 
            and UI of a form's design. I thought this article was very informative 
            and helped me understand the UX approach and thinking process 
            in creating a form on a website or an online application. Ansari mentions
            “Minimizing the Input fields”, which I think is one of the most important steps. 
            In order to create an organized form, I agree that you should try to make it simple 
            but make sure it contains the important information/fields for the user to fill out 
            so the information is not overwhelming. </p>

            <p>I also thought the article pointed out that it was important to include labels and
            make the questions easy at first. It made me realize that the beginning is the 
            hardest part of creating the form because I think that when the user is going 
            through the form, if it asks the complicated questions at form it would drive 
            the user away from finishing the document. Asking the most interesting questions 
            first, is important because I believe that the psychology of users tend to go towards
            topics or questions that make them curious or interesting to them, making them want 
            to finish the form. The label aspect of the form is also significant in creating a 
            great design for a form. Labels are beneficial in creating a more efficient way of 
            completing and communicating to the users of what they have to answer or what the question is about.</p>

            <p>One website form that I thought was very easy to interact with is<a href = "https://www.google.com/forms/about/">Google Form.</a>I
            thought the UI was very simple and a really good use of space between each question. 
            There is the question that is usually divided with a line so that the user can differentiate
            what the question is and what part they have to answer. Another reason why I think google form 
            is a good example is the negative space it has in the form. The amount of space between the 
            questions helps make the words easy to read, organized, and simple. </p>
