            <p>According to the article by Medium named, Best Practices for Form Design,
            written by Salim Ansari, mentions the significance of forming the right UX 
            and UI of a form’s design. I thought this article was very informative 
            and helped me understand the UX approach and thinking process 
            in creating a form on a website or an online application. Ansari mentions
            “Minimizing the Input fields”, which I think is one of the most important steps. 
            In order to create an organized form, I agree that you should try to make it simple 
            but make sure it contains the important information/fields for the user to fill out 
            so the information is not overwhelming. </p>

            <p>I also thought the article pointed out that it was important to include labels and
            make the questions easy at first. It made me realize that the beginning is the 
            hardest part of creating the form because I think that when the user is going 
            through the form, if it asks the complicated questions at form it would drive 
            the user away from finishing the document. Asking the most interesting questions 
            first, is important because I believe that the psychology of users tend to go towards
            topics or questions that make them curious or interesting to them, making them want 
            to finish the form. The label aspect of the form is also significant in creating a 
            great design for a form. Labels are beneficial in creating a more efficient way of 
            completing and communicating to the users of what they have to answer or what the question is about.</p>

            <p>One website form that I thought was very easy to interact with is<a href = "https://www.google.com/forms/about/">Google Form.</a>I
            thought the UI was very simple and a really good use of space between each question. 
            There is the question that is usually divided with a line so that the user can differentiate
            what the question is and what part they have to answer. Another reason why I think google form 
            is a good example is the negative space it has in the form. The amount of space between the 
            questions helps make the words easy to read, organized, and simple. </p>
