        <p> In the article, my medium titled, Game Design Best Practices, Amir Dori, mentions his experience with Game Design and describes
             the best UX practices when it comes to Game design. I think that games are something a lot of people are investing their time 
             in daily. I think that UX practices are crucial in website design but I also think that it is especially important games. 
             It is important to think about the user perspectives in game design because in my experience there are times when 
             I am confused about where to navigate and how to start the game. For example, I had an experience with a kick-boxing game 
             in my app store, however, the first thing that popped up was just visuals of the game design, and some of the icons and 
             sections of the game were hidden so I would have to click through several game icons in order to find what I wanted 
             to use and setup for the game. I had eventually stopped playing the game because I was frusterated with how hard it was 
             to navigate everytime I played, and the game also did not remember the user so it would reset everytime I played.</p>
             <p>The article also mentions UI positions and pop-ups, and I think this really helps with the experience of how the user will
                feel about the game. I played a game called “Royal Match” which was similar to the game called “Candy Crush”, 
                and it was very comfortable to use because depending on the user you can use your left hand 
                to play the game or your right hand to play the game. Also, there were a lot of pop-ups of rewards that I have earned 
                and different levels that I have reached. There were also many chances that would pop up throughout the game in order 
                to be able to earn more points. I think the pop-ups, made me addicted to the game because whenever I had a chance 
                to earn more lives for the game, I would keep on playing the game and it was fun because it was challenging, easy to 
                navigate, and satisfying whenever I finished a level.</p>

            <img src="images/Pandora.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
            <figcaption>Fig.1 - Pandora Bracelet.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        <p> For my visual thinking analysis, I chose a Pandora bracelet picture, which is shown above. The image is interesting because it is my bracelet that is collected with memories. 
            I have seven different charms on the bracelet that I have collected throughout the years. </p>
        <p>Each bracelet is a memory of where and when I got it. Another part of the bracelet 
            that makes it more special is the different personalities that represent me. For instance, the two blue charms represent that I love the ocean and the color blue and I got 
            it on my trip to New York. The wine glass represents when I finally became 21 years old. The “family” charms embrace the different meaningful friendships that I cherish in 
            my life. It is a bracelet that collects the different memories I had gathered during my independence in college.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/food.JPG" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
            <figcaption>Fig.1 - Annabelle's Picture</figcaption>
            </figure>
        <p>I think the image of the pastry is about my partner’s, Annabelle, interest in baking and also taking pictures of 
            different dishes she has made. The image is very interesting because I can interpret the image that 
            maybe she likes to bake, she likes pastries, or she likes taking pictures of different foods she has eaten.
            I also can see that maybe the food that she has shared with me is a pastry that she is very good at, comfort 
            food of hers, and likes to bake and also is most proud of.</p>
        <p>I also love the vibrance in the picture where you can notice the different details of each pastry. For instance,
            the obvious aspect of the picture is the different shapes and glazes each pastry has. Another detail is 
            that there is one with a sausage and one with green onions. The location is a kitchen which indicates 
            that it is baked at a home rather than a cafe or restaurant. The mysterious aspect of the image is why
            there are two types of pastries, and whether it is something she has baked or someone else has baked for her. </p>

        <p>In the article by New York Times named, 10 Intriguing photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills, 
        written by Michael Gonchar, states in the article about the importance of visual thinking skills when it comes to 
        reading or even looking at a picture. I think this is an important skill not only in design but for any career. 
        I realized that it is quite hard to actually pay attention to every detail in a picture. This quarter I am taking 
        an art history class and one of our assignments was to write an ekphrastic essay. In order to write this essay I 
        had to pay attention to what visual components are included in the painting, what is going on in the painting, and 
        lastly how can I connect my knowledge of art history and themes to what the meaning of the painting is. I think 
        visual thinking skills were very beneficial when it came to design, because it helped me pay attention to detail 
        a lot faster and also build my own opinion or thought of what I see. Other people also share what they see and it 
        leads to interpreting many ideas of what I think the picture or painting is about. Having visual thinking skills
        also helped me understand and think of ways I could make certain designs more interactive and like a novel. I think 
        when I go into someone’s else's<a href = "https://www.awwwards.com/sites/sanctuary-on-the-moon">portfolio</a>and I see very aesthetic and interactive parts in their websites it makes 
        me feel like I'm looking at a story rather than just projects that they have completed.</p>

        <p>According to the article named, Best Practice for Modals/ Overlays/ Dialog Windows, written by Naema Baskanderi,
        talks about the best way to create a user interface for the design of a modal, overlays, and dialog windows. I 
        thought this article was very informative on how to create a good modal design for users that are scrolling through
        the website. The article mentions the different ways that modals are used in the interface design, and one of the 
        ways that I agree most with was that modals “grab the user's attention”. The reason why I think modals grab the 
        attention of hundreds of users is because it acts like a pop-up and so sometimes you can't see the overall 
        UI of the website, however, you only see the modal window. The user can only see most of the content in 
        the modal but you can't see the website page because the modal is in front of it. For example, when I was 
        trying to log into a new article website like Washington Post, I could have a few articles to read, however 
        after I used up all the free articles, they would pop up a sign-up modal for the user to sign up and pay monthly 
        to be able to read unlimited articles. This technique had definitely made me only focus on the modal because everything
        in the background (website page) was blurred so that I am only allowed to see the sign-up modal rather than the articles.
        I think it is important to blur a background when a modal is popped up, because it becomes a focal point and there aren't
        other things behind the modal that are distracting for the user.</p>

            <p>According to the article by Medium named, Best Practices for Form Design,
            written by Salim Ansari, mentions the significance of forming the right UX 
            and UI of a form's design. I thought this article was very informative 
            and helped me understand the UX approach and thinking process 
            in creating a form on a website or an online application. Ansari mentions
            “Minimizing the Input fields”, which I think is one of the most important steps. 
            In order to create an organized form, I agree that you should try to make it simple 
            but make sure it contains the important information/fields for the user to fill out 
            so the information is not overwhelming. </p>

            <p>I also thought the article pointed out that it was important to include labels and
            make the questions easy at first. It made me realize that the beginning is the 
            hardest part of creating the form because I think that when the user is going 
            through the form, if it asks the complicated questions at form it would drive 
            the user away from finishing the document. Asking the most interesting questions 
            first, is important because I believe that the psychology of users tend to go towards
            topics or questions that make them curious or interesting to them, making them want 
            to finish the form. The label aspect of the form is also significant in creating a 
            great design for a form. Labels are beneficial in creating a more efficient way of 
            completing and communicating to the users of what they have to answer or what the question is about.</p>

            <p>One website form that I thought was very easy to interact with is<a href = "https://www.google.com/forms/about/">Google Form.</a>I
            thought the UI was very simple and a really good use of space between each question. 
            There is the question that is usually divided with a line so that the user can differentiate
            what the question is and what part they have to answer. Another reason why I think google form 
            is a good example is the negative space it has in the form. The amount of space between the 
            questions helps make the words easy to read, organized, and simple. </p>
